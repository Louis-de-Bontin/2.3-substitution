## Encripting script coded in Rust
- Enter the key as a command line argument, composed of 26 different characters
- Then enter the plain text
- The script will replace each letter by the corresponding one in the key
- The script is not case sensitive (an uppercase in the plain text will be uppercase in the cypher text)
- Exemple :</br>
The key is AZERTYUIopQSDfGHJKLMWXCvbn </br>
`Hello!` will be `Itssg!` </br>
`aBC` will be `aZE`
